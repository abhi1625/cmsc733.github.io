## 1. Deadline 
**11:59PM, Thursday, April 11, 2019.**

<a name='intro'></a>
## 2. Introduction
We have been playing with images for so long, mostly in 2D scene. Recall [project 1](/2019/proj/p1) where we stitched multiple images with about 30-50% common features between a couple of images. Now let's learn how to **reconstruct a 3D scene and simultaneously obtain the camera poses** of a monocular camera w.r.t. the given scene. This procedure is known as Structure from Motion (SfM). As the name suggests, you are creating the entire **rigid** structure from a set of images with different view points (or equivalently a camera in motion). A few years ago, Agarwal et. al published [Building Rome in a Day](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/rome/rome_paper.pdf) in which they reconstructed the entire city just by using a large collection of photos from the Internet. Ever heard of Microsoft [Photosynth?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynth) _Facinating? isn't it!?_ There are a few open source SfM algorithm available online like [VisualSFM](http://ccwu.me/vsfm/). _Try them!_ 

Let's learn how to recreate such algorithm. There are a few steps that collectively form SfM:

- **Feature Matching** and Outlier rejection using **RANSAC**
- Estimating **Fundamental Matrix**
- Estimating **Essential Matrix** from Fundamental Matrix
- Estimate **Camera Pose** from Essential Matrix
- Check for **Cheirality Condition** using **Triangulation** 
- **Perspective-n-Point**
- **Bundle Adjustment**

*(If you haven't heard of the above terminology before, don't worry! If you knew the following already, you wouldn't be taking the class right now!)*

## 3. Phase 1: Traditional Approach

<a name='featmatch'></a>
### 3.1. Feature Matching, Fundamental Matrix and RANSAC
We have already learned about keypoint matching using SIFT keypoints and descriptors (Recall Project 2: Panorama Stitching). It is important to refine the matches by rejecting outline correspondence.
Before rejecting the correspondences, let us first understand what Fundamental matrix is!

### 3.2. Estimating Fundamental Matrix 
The fundamental matrix, denoted by $$F$$, is a $$3\times 3$$ (_rank 2_) matrix that relates the corresponding set of points in two images from different views (or stereo images). But in order to understand what fundamental matrix actually is, we need to understand what _epipolar geometry_ is! The epipolar geometry is the intrinsic projective geometry between two views. It only depends on the cameras' internal parameters ($$K$$ matrix) and the relative pose _i.e._ it is **independent of the scene structure**. 

<a name='epipole'></a>
#### 3.2.1. Epipolar Geometry
Let's say a point $$\mathbf{X}$$ in the 3D-space (viewed in two images) is captured as $$\mathbf{x}$$ in the first image and $$\mathbf{x'}$$ in the second. _Can you think how to formulate the relation between the corresponding image points $$\mathbf{x}$$ and $$\mathbf{x'}$$?_ Consider Fig. 2. Let $$\mathbf{C}$$ and $$\mathbf{C'}$$ be the respective camera centers which forms the baseline for the stereo system. Clearly, the points $$\mathbf{x}$$, $$\mathbf{x'}$$ and $$\mathbf{X}$$ (or $$\mathbf{C}$$, $$\mathbf{C'}$$ and $$\mathbf{X}$$) are coplanar _i.e._  $$\mathbf{\overrightarrow{Cx}}\cdot \left(\mathbf{\overrightarrow{CC'}}\times\mathbf{\overrightarrow{C'x'}}\right)=0$$ 
and the plane formed can be denoted by $$\pi$$. Since these points are coplanar, the rays back-projected from $$\mathbf{x}$$ and $$\mathbf{x'}$$ intersect at $$\mathbf{X}$$. This is the most significant property in searching for a correspondence.

  </div>
</div>


Now, let us say that only $$\mathbf{x}$$ is known, not $$\mathbf{x'}$$. We know that the point $$\mathbf{x'}$$ lies in the plane $$\pi$$ which is governed by the camera baseline $$\mathbf{CC'}$$ and $$\mathbf{\overrightarrow{Cx}}$$.  Hence the point $$\mathbf{x'}$$ lies on the line of intersetion of $$\mathbf{l'}$$ of $$\pi$$ with the second image plane. The line $$\mathbf{l'}$$ is the image in the second view of the ray back-projected from $$\mathbf{x}$$. This line $$\mathbf{l'}$$ is called the _epipolar line_ corresponding to $$\mathbf{x}$$. The benifit is that you don't need to search for the point corresponding to $$\mathbf{x}$$ in the entire image plane as it can be restricted to the $$\mathbf{l'}$$.

- **Epipole** is the point of intersection of the line joining the camera centers with the image plane. (see $$\mathbf{e}$$ and $$\mathbf{e'}$$ in the Fig. 2(a)) 
- **Epipolar plane** is the plane containing the baseline.
- **Epipolar line** is the intersection of an epipolar plane with the image plane. *All the epipolar lines intersect at the epipole.* 

<a name='estfundmatrix'></a>
#### 3.2.2. The Fundamental Matrix $$\mathbf{F}$$

The $$\mathbf{F}$$ matrix is only an algebraic representation of epipolar geometry and can both geometrically _(contructing the epipolar line)_ and arithematically. ([See derivation](http://cvrs.whu.edu.cn/downloads/ebooks/Multiple%20View%20Geometry%20in%20Computer%20Vision%20\(Second%20Edition\).pdf)) ([Fundamental Matrix Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgGV3l82NTk))
As a result, we obtain:
$$\mathbf{x}_i'^{\ \mathbf{T}}\mathbf{F} \mathbf{x}_i = 0$$
where $$i=1,2,....,m.$$ 
This is known as epipolar constraint or correspondance condition (or _Longuet-Higgins_ equation). Since, $$\mathbf{F}$$ is a $$3\times3$$ matrix, we can set up a homogenrous linear system with 9 unknowns:

$$\begin{bmatrix} x'_i & y'_i & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}f_{11} & f_{12} & f_{13} \\ f_{21} & f_{22} & f_{23} \\ f_{31} & f_{32} & f_{33} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ y_i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = 0$$ 


$$\begin{equation}x_i x'_i f_{11} + x_i y'_i f_{21} + x_i f_{31} + y_i x'_i f_{12} + y_i y'_i f_{22} + y_i f_{32} +  x'_i f_{13} + y'_i f_{23} + f_{33}=0\end{equation}$$
<br><br>

Simplifying for $$m$$ correspondences,

$$\begin{bmatrix} x_1 x'_1 & x_1 y'_1 & x_1 & y_1 x'_1 & y_1 y'_1 & y_1 &  x'_1 & y'_1 & 1 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ x_m x'_m & x_m y'_m & x_m & y_m x'_m & y_m y'_m & y_m &  x'_m & y'_m & 1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} f_{11} \\ f_{21} \\ f_{31} \\ f_{12} \\ f_{22} \\ f_{32} \\ f_{13} \\f_{23} \\ f_{33}\end{bmatrix} = 0$$

**_How many points do we need to solve the above equation? Think! Twice!_** 
Remember _homography_, where each point correspondence contributes two constraints? Unlike homography, in $$\mathbf{F}$$ matrix estimation, each point only contributes one constraints as the epipolar constraint is a scalar equation.
Thus, we require at least 8 points to solve the above homogenous system. That is why it is known as [Eight-point algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-point_algorithm).

With $$N \geq 8$$ correspondences between two images, the fundamental matrix, $$F$$ can be obtained as:
By stacking the above equation in a matrix $$A$$, the equation
$$Ax=0$$ is obtained.
	This system of equation can be answered by solving the linear least squares using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as explained in the <a href="https://cmsc426.github.io/math-tutorial/#svd">Math module</a>. When applying SVD to matrix $$\mathbf{A}$$, the decomposition $$\mathbf{USV^T}$$ would be obtained with $$\mathbf{U}$$ and $$\mathbf{V}$$ orthonormal matrices and a diagonal matrix $$\mathbf{S}$$ that contains the singular values. The singular values $$\sigma_i$$ where $$i\in[1,9], i\in\mathbb{Z}$$, are positive and are in decreasing order with $$\sigma_9=0$$ since we have 8 equations for 9 unknowns. Thus, the last column of $$\mathbf{V}$$ is the true solution given that $$\sigma_i\neq 0 \  \forall i\in[1,8], i\in\mathbb{Z}$$. However, due to noise in the correspondences, the estimated $$\mathbf{F}$$ matrix can be of rank 3 _i.e._ $$\sigma_9\neq0$$. So, to enfore the rank 2 constraint, the last singular value of the estimated $$\mathbf{F}$$ must be set to zero. If $$F$$ has a full rank then it will have an empty null-space _i.e._ it won't have any point that is on entire set of lines. Thus, there wouldn't be any epipoles. See Fig. 3 for full rank comparisons for $$F$$ matrices.

  <div class="figcaption">
 	Figure 3: F Matrix: Rank 3 vs Rank 2 comparison
  </div>
  <div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>



In MATLAB, you can use `svd` to solve $$\mathbf{x}$$ from $$\mathbf{Ax}=0$$
```
[U, S, V] = svd(A);
x = V(:, end);
F = reshape(x, [3,3])';
```



<a name='ransac'></a>
#### 3.2.3. Match Outlier Rejection via RANSAC

Since the point correspondences are computed using SIFT or some other feature descriptors, the data is bound to be noisy and (in general) contains several outliers. Thus, to remove these outliers, we use RANSAC algorithm _(Yes! The same as used in Panorama stitching!)_ to obtain a better estimate of the fundamental matrix. So, out of all possibilities, the $$\mathbf{F}$$ matrix with maximum number of inliers is chosen.
Below is the pseduo-code that returns the $$\mathbf{F}$$ matrix for a set of matching corresponding points (computed using SIFT) which maximizes the number of inliers.

<a name='estE'></a>
### 3.3. Estimate *Essential Matrix* from Fundamental Matrix

Since we have computed the $$\mathbf{F}$$ using epipolar constrains, we can find the relative camera poses between the two images. This can be computed using the *Essential Matrix*, $$\mathbf{E}$$. Essential matrix is another $$3\times3$$ matrix, but with some additional properties that relates the corresponding points assuming that the cameras obeys the pinhole model (unlike $$\mathbf{F}$$). More specifically, 
$$\mathbf{E}$$ = $$\mathbf{K^TFK}$$
where $$\mathbf{K}$$ is the camera calibration matrix or camera intrinsic matrix. Clearly, the essential matrix can be extracted from $$\mathbf{F}$$ and $$\mathbf{K}$$. As in the case of $$\mathbf{F}$$ matrix computation, the singular values of $$\mathbf{E}$$ are not necessarily $$(1,1,0)$$ due to the noise in $$\mathbf{K}$$. This can be corrected by reconstructing it with $$(1,1,0)$$ singular values, _i.e._
$$\mathbf{E}=U\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}V^T$$

_It is important to note that the $$\mathbf{F}$$ is defined in the original image space (i.e. pixel coordinates) whereas $$\mathbf{E}$$ is in the normalized image coordinates. Normalized image coordinates have the origin at the optical center of the image. Also, relative camera poses between two views can be computed using $$\mathbf{E}$$ matrix. Moreover, $$\mathbf{F}$$ has 7 degrees of freedom while $$\mathbf{E}$$ has 5 as it takes camera parameters in account. ([5-Point Motion Estimation Made Easy](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/new5pt_cameraREady_ver_1.pdf))_

<a name='essential'></a>
### 3.4. Estimate **Camera Pose** from Essential Matrix
The camera pose consists of 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) Rotation (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) and Translation (X, Y, Z) of the camera with respect to the world. Since the $$\mathbf{E}$$ matrix is identified, the four camera pose configurations: $$(C_1, R_1), (C_2, R_2), (C_3, R_3)$$ and $$(C_4, R4)$$ where $$\ C\in\mathbb{R}^3$$ is the camera center and $$R\in SO(3)$$ is the rotation matrix, can be computed. Thus, the camera pose can be written as:
$$P = KR\begin{bmatrix}I_{3\times3} & -C\end{bmatrix}$$
These four pose configurations can be computed from $$\mathbf{E}$$ matrix. Let $$\mathbf{E}=UDV^T$$ and $$W=\begin{bmatrix}0 & -1 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$. The four configurations can be written as: 
1. $$C_1=U(:, 3)$$ and $$R_1=UWV^T$$
2. $$C_2=-U(:, 3)$$ and $$R_2=UWV^T$$
3. $$C_3=U(:, 3)$$ and $$R_3=UW^TV^T$$
4. $$C_4=-U(:, 3)$$ and $$R_4=UW^TV^T$$

**It is important to note that the $$\ det(R)=1$$. If $$det(R)=-1$$, the camera pose must be corrected _i.e._ $$C=-C$$ and $$R=-R$$.**

<a name='tri'></a>
### 3.5. Check for **Cheirality Condition** using **Triangulation**
In the previous section, we computed four different possible camera poses for a pair of images using essential matrix. Though, in order to find the _correct_ unique camera pose, we need to remove the disambiguity. This can be accomplish by checking the **cheirality condition** _i.e._ *the reconstructed points must be in front of the cameras*. 
To check the cheirality condition, triangulate the 3D points (given two camera poses) using **linear least squares** to check the sign of the depth $$Z$$ in the camera coordinate system w.r.t. camera center. A 3D point $$X$$ is in front of the camera iff:
$$r_3\mathbf{(X-C)} > 0$$
where $$r_3$$ is the third row of the rotation matrix (z-axis of the camera). Not all triangulated points satisfy this coniditon due of the presence of correspondence noise. The best camera configuration, $$(C, R, X)$$ is the one that produces the maximum number of points satisfying the cheirality condition.

  <div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>



<a name='nonlintri'></a>
#### 3.5.1. Non-Linear Triangulation
Given two camera poses and linearly triangulated points, $$X$$, the locations of the 3D points that minimizes the reprojection error (Recall [Project 2](https://cmsc426.github.io/pano/#reproj)) can be refined. The linear triangulation minimizes the algebraic error. Though, the reprojection error is geometrically meaningful error and can be computed by measuring error between measurement and projected 3D point:<br>
$$\underset{x}{\operatorname{min}}$$ $$\sum_{j=1,2}\left(u^j - \frac{P_1^{jT}\widetilde{\phi}}{P_3^{jT}{X}}\right)^2 + \left(v^j - \frac{P_2^{jT}\widetilde{\phi}}{P_3^{jT}{X}}\right)^2$$

Here, $$j$$ is the index of each camera, $$\widetilde{X}$$ is the hoomogeneous representation of $$X$$. $$P_i^T$$ is each row of camera projection matrix, $$P$$. This minimization is highly nonlinear due to the divisions. The initial guess of the solution, $$X_0$$, is estimated via the linear triangulation to minimize the cost function. This minimization can be solved using nonlinear optimization toolbox such as `fminunc` or `lsqnonlin` in MATLAB.

<a name='pnp'></a>
### 3.6. Perspective-$$n$$-Points

Now, since we have a set of $$n$$ 3D points in the world, their $$2D$$ projections in the image and the intrinsic parameter; the 6 DOF camera pose can be estimated using linear least squares. This fundamental problem, in general is known as _Persepective_-$$n$$-_Point_ (PnP). For there to exist a solution, $$n\geq 3$$. There are multiple methods to solve the P$$n$$P problem and have an assumptions in most of them that the camera is calibrated. Methods such as [Unified P$$n$$P](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f1d6/2775d4a51161663ff9453b37bb21a1263f25.pdf) (or UPnP) do not abide with the said assumption as they estimate both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.

P$$n$$P is prone to error as there are outliers in the given set of point correspondences. To overcome this error, we can use RANSAC (yes, again!) to make our camera pose more robust to outliers. The alogrithm below depicts the solution with RANSAC.

<div class="fig fighighlight">
  <img src="/assets/sfm/pnpransac.png"  width="80%">
  <div class="figcaption">

  </div>
  <div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>

Just like in triangulation, since we have the linearly estimated camera pose, we can refine the camera pose that minimizes the reprojection error (Linear PnP only minimizes the algebraic error). Though, reprojection error is the geometrically meaningful error and can be computed by measuring error between measurement and projected 3D point.

$$\underset{C,R}{\operatorname{min}} \sum_{i=1,J} \left(u^j - \frac{P_1^{jT}\widetilde{X_j}}{P_3^{jT}{\widetilde{X_j}}}\right)^2 + \left(v^j - \frac{P_2^{jT}\widetilde{X_j}}{P_3^{jT}{X_j}}\right)^2$$

### 3.7. Bundle Adjustment

Once you have computed all the camera poses and 3D points, we need to refine the poses and 3D points together, initialized by previous reconstruction by minimizing reporjection error.
<div class="fig fighighlight">
  <img src="/assets/sfm/BA.png"  width="80%">
  <div class="figcaption">
 	Figure 7: The final reconstructed scene after Sparse Bundle Adjustment (SBA).
  </div>
  <div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>
The optimization problem can formulated as following:

$$\underset{\{C_i, q_i\}_{i=1}^i,\{X\}_{j=1}^J}{\operatorname{min}}\sum_{i=1}^I\sum_{j=1}^J V_{ij}\left(\left(u^j - \dfrac{P_1^{jT}\tilde{\phi}}{P_3^{jT}\tilde{X}}\right)^2 + \left(v^j - \dfrac{P_2^{jT}\tilde{\phi}}{P_3^{jT}\tilde{X}}\right)^2\right)$$
where $$V_{ij}$$ is the visibility matrix.
(_Don't scratch your head yet!_)

 Visibility matrix signifies the relationship between the camera and a point. $$V_{ij}$$ is one if $$j^{th}$$ point is visible from the $$i^{th}$$ camera and zero otherwise. One can use a nonlinear optimization toolbox such as `fminunc` or `lsqnonlin` in MATLAB but is extremely slow as the number of parameters are large. The <i>Sparse Bundle Adjustment</i> toolbox is designed to solve such optimization problem by exploiting sparsity of visibility matrix, $$V$$.

Clearly, solving such a method to compute the structure from motion is complex and slow _(can take from several minutes for only 8-10 images)_. The above steps collectively is the traditional way of solving the problem of SfM. However, the solution to the problem of structure from motion can be made more robust with deep learning. 

<a name='sfmlearner'></a>
## 4. Phase 2: Deep Learning Approach (SfMLearner)

To achieve more robust results, we are going to implement an unsupervised deep learning framework ([SfMLearner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/SfMLearner/cvpr17_sfm_final.pdf)) to estimate monocular depth and camera motion from continuous set of frames. This is an end-to-end learning approach that will basically replace all the steps from feature matching to non linear PnP.   

One of the trivial ways to do it is to learn rotation and translation from a sequence of data. Although, learning such parameters directly is weakly constrained. Thus, methods like SfMLearner, jointly train a single view depth CNN and a camera pose estimation CNN from unlabeled video sequence. 

Assumption: The scene is fairly rigid <i>i.e.</i> the scene appearance change across different frames is dominated by the camera motion.

<b> You are required to read [SfMLearner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/SfMLearner/cvpr17_sfm_final.pdf) paper before reading further. </b>

### 4.1. View Synthesis
The key supervision signal for our depth and pose prediction CNNs comes from the task of novel view synthesis: given one input view of a scene, synthesize a new image of the scene seen from a different camera pose. We can synthesize a target view given a per-pixel depth in that image, plus the pose and visibility in a nearby view. Thus, synthesizing the target view works as a supervision for training. The view synthesis objective can be formulated as:

$$ L_{vs} = \sum_s \sum_p |I_t(p) - \hat{I_s}(p)|$$ 
where $$p$$ indexes over pixel coordinates and $$\hat{I_s}$$ is the source view $$I_s$$ warped to the target coordinate frame based on a depth imae-based rendering module. See Figure xx for an illustration of SfMLearner learning pipeline for depth and pose estimation. 

<div class="fig fighighlight">

  <div class="figcaption">
  Figure xx: Overview of the supervision pipeline based on view synthesis.
  </div>
  <div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>


### 4.2. Differentiable Depth Image-based Rendering
A key component of this framework is a differentiable depth image-based renderer (Refer section 3.1 of the paper) that reconstructs the target view $$I_t$$ by sampling pixels from a source view $$I_s$$ based on the predicted depth map $$\hat{D_t}$$ and the relative pose $$\hat{T}_{t\rightarrow s}$$

Fig. xx is an illustration of the differentiable image warping process. 
<div class="fig fighighlight">
  <img src="/assets/2019/p3/image-warp.png"  width="80%">
  <div class="figcaption">
  Figure xx: For each point \(p_t\) in the target view, we first project it onto the source view based on the predicted depth and camera pose, and then use bilinear interpolation to obtain the value of the warped image \(\hat{I}_s\) at location \(p_t\).
  </div>
  <div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>

To obtain $$I_s(p_s)$$ for populating the value of $$\hat{I}_s(p_t)$$, we use the differentiable bilinear sampling mechanism proposed in the spatial transformer networks(STN) that linearly interpolates the values of the 4-pixel neighboring pixels of $$p_s$$ to approximate $$I_s(p_s)$$. For this project, you may 'use' STN rather than writing your own. A sample tensorflow implementation of STN can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinzakka/spatial-transformer-network). Feel free to use any other implementation.


### 4.3. Explainability Mask

<b>Note</b>: Till now, we assume the scene is static; there are no occlusions between the target and source views; the surface is Lambertian so that the photo-consistency error is meaningful. With any of the these assumptions voilated in the training sequence, the gradients could be corrupted. To improve the robustness of our training process, we separately train a <i>explainability prediction</i> network that outputs a per-pixel soft mask $$\hat{E}_s$$ for each  target-source pair. 

Thus, the view synthesis objective is updated as:

$$ L_{vs} = \sum_s \sum_p \hat{E}_s(p)\ |I_t(p) - \hat{I_s}(p)|$$ 


### 4.4. Gradient Locality Issues

There is still another problem that needs to be dealt with. The gradients in the framework are mainly derived from the pixel intensity difference between the center pixel and its neighbours which will cause problems in training if the correct $$p_s$$ (neighbour pixel) is located in a low-texture region. This is a common issue in motion estimation. To overcome this problem, we can use a encoder-decoder CNN with a small bottleneck for the depth network that implicitly constrains the output to be globally smooth and facilitates gradients to propogate from meaningful regions to nearby regions. 
Thus, for smoothness, we minimize the $$L_1$$ norm of second-order gradients for the predicted depth maps:

$$L_{final} = \sum_l L^l_{vs} + \lambda_s L^l_{smooth} + \lambda_e \sum_s L_{reg}(\hat{E}^l_s)$$

where $$l$$ indexes over different images scales, $$s$$ indexes over source images and $$\lambda_s$$ and $$\lambda_e$$ are weighting for the depth smoothness loss and explainability regularization respectively.

The network architecture is given below:

<b> If your submission does not comply with the following guidelines, you'll be given ZERO credit </b>

<a name='files'></a>
### 6.1. File tree and naming

Your submission on ELMS/Canvas must be a ``zip`` file, following the naming convention ``YourDirectoryID_p3.zip``. If you email ID is ``abc@umd.edu`` or ``abc@terpmail.umd.edu``, then your ``DirectoryID`` is ``abc``. For our example, the submission file should be named ``abc_p1.zip``. The file **must have the following directory structure** because we'll be autograding assignments. The file to run for your project should be called ``Wrapper.py``. You can have any helper functions in sub-folders as you wish, be sure to index them using relative paths and if you have command line arguments for your Wrapper codes, make sure to have default values too. Please provide detailed instructions on how to run your code in ``README.md`` file. Please **DO NOT** include data in your submission.

### 6.2. Report

For each section of the project, explain briefly what you did, and describe any interesting problems you encountered and/or solutions you implemented.  You must include the following details in your writeup:

- Your report **MUST** be typeset in LaTeX in the IEEE Tran format provided to you in the ``Draft`` folder and should of a conference quality paper.
- Present the Data you collected in ``Data`` folder with names ``Data1.mp4`` and ``Data2.mp4`` (Be sure to have the format as ``.mp4`` **ONLY**).
- Present the output videos for Triangulation, TPS and PRNet as ``Data1OutputTri.mp4``, ``Data1OutputTPS.mp4`` and ``Data1OutputPRNet.mp4`` for Data 1 respectively in the ``Data`` folder. Also, present outputs videos for Triangulation, TPS and PRNet as ``Data2OutputTri.mp4``, ``Data2OutputTPS.mp4`` and ``Data2OutputPRNet.mp4`` for Data 2 respectively in the ``Data`` folder. (Be sure to have the format as ``.mp4`` **ONLY**).
- For Phase 1, present input and output images for two frames from each of the videos using both Triangulation and TPS approach.
- For Phase 2, present input and output images for two frames from each of the videos using PRNet approach.
- Present failure cases for both Phase 1 and 2 and present your thoughts on why the failure occurred.

## 7. Collaboration Policy
You are encouraged to discuss the ideas with your peers. However, the code should be your own, and should be the result of you exercising your own understanding of it. If you reference anyone else's code in writing your project, you must properly cite it in your code (in comments) and your writeup. For the full honor code refer to the CMSC733 Spring 2019 website.
